In this repository, we explore the evolution of paratenesis in complex life cycle parasites.

# Background

Parasitic worms with complex life cycles like tapeworms, flukes, nematodes and acanthocephalans must infect multiple hosts in succession. Flexibility - being able to facultatively skip hosts - would clearly be beneficial. When do parasites facultatively skip their intermediate hosts?

# Data

The main data source for this study is a [database](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1680) I published on the life cycles of parasitic worms. Taxonomic information was obtained from [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) and the [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/).

# Analyses

[Here](analyses/paratenics_in_lcs.md) we explore which hosts are usually paratenic hosts. And [here](analyses/paratenics_as_bridges.md) we explore whether these hosts fill an ecological need.

# Conclusions
