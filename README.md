In this repository, we explore the evolution of paratenesis in complex life cycle parasites.

# Background

Parasitic worms with complex life cycles like tapeworms, flukes, nematodes and acanthocephalans must infect multiple hosts in succession. Flexibility - being able to facultatively skip hosts - would clearly be beneficial. When do parasites facultatively skip their intermediate hosts?

# Data

The main data source for this study is a [database](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1680) I published on the life cycles of parasitic worms. Taxonomic information was obtained from [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) and the [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/).

# Analyses

[Here](analyses/paratenics_in_lcs.md) we explore which hosts are usually paratenic hosts. And [here](analyses/paratenics_as_bridges.md) we explore whether these hosts fulfill an ecological need.

# Conclusions

The results suggest that paratenesis occurs mainly in later life stages when the changes in host mass/trophic level are smaller. Moreover, paratenic hosts fill smaller gaps than obligate hosts at a given life stage. The gaps are not trivial, though, suggesting skipping hosts is probably associated with lower transmission. Finally, parasites enter paratenic hosts slightly larger than obligate intermediate hosts, which may result in less need to grow, higher generalism, and thus lower worm mortality.
